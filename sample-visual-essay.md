## Introduction

Pedanius Dioscorides was a Greek physician, pharmacologist, and botanist who lived from approximately 40 to 90 CE. While serving as a military physician in the Roman army under Nero, Dioscorides compiled vast knowledge on medical uses for plant, animal, mineral, and fungal simples. The results of this effort is his five-volume collection of manuscripts titled De Materia Medica, or On Medical Material, which he wrote in his native greek. Building off his own knowledge as a physician, previous writings, and local traditions in the Mediterranean, Dioscorides produced the most detailed treatise of the Ancient world. These volumes contain information on over 5000 medical uses and recipes intended to treat an immense variety of ailments including abscesses, tumors, hemorrhoids, animal bites, stings, psychosomatic ailments, dysentery, spasms, and other assorted illnesses

## Cardamom

Of the 592 simples featured in De Materia Medica, one that links it to many other ancient treatises is cardamom. The manuscript describes it as having "warming, astringent, desiccative, soporific, and analgesic properties. Soothes inflammations of the eyes, internal organs, liver disease, kidney disease, gout, and female disorders."

## Why Dioscorides?

While Dioscorides’s  manuscript was highly utilized and respected by his immediate successors in the ancient world, it continued to find frequent use well into the middle ages and only grew in popularity. The medieval world produced no shortage of medical pharmacopeias, so why was it that Dioscorides work outlasted those that came after it and how did it travel across the medieval world? The answer to this can be found in the changes made to De Materia Medica in the middle ages. Of these alterations: the addition of images, various translations, and the creation of an abridged version proved to be especially important in its dominance over medieval pharmacopeia.

## Illustrations

One of the most iconic changes came somewhere around the third or fourth century in the form of illustrations. These illustrations served to increase the overall usefulness of the manuscript for physicians but also added artistic value relevant to those outside the world of medicine. The illustrations would eventually grow to become one of the primary subjects of modern research regarding this text.

## Liber Dioscoridis de Herbis Femininis

In addition to the illustrations, De Materia Medica was adapted into the much more concise Liber Dioscoridis de Herbis Femininis in order to meet the demand for shorter medical texts. This version notably omits most of the information on animal and mineral drugs while adding content from other sources with no affiliation to Dioscorides. With these changes the herbarium grew in popularity immensely, even being offered in a five book collection which compiled the authoritative sources of early medieval materia medica.

## Translations

Finally, perhaps most the most important element in Dioscorides’s ability to spread throughout the medieval world was its various translations. From its original Greek, De Materia Medica was translated into Latin, Syriac, and Arabic during the middle ages. The prevalence of translations of  De Materia Medica in the hands of high profile Arabic officials and physicians proves the value it brought to the Arabic world. However; it is important to note that this was not simply a one-way exchange. Within De Materia Medica, approximately 30 drugs are derived from imported plants originating from Africa, Arabia, Central Asia, and the Indo-Malayan ecozone. This demonstrates the Mediterranean and Arabic world’s mutually beneficial relationship centered around the bilateral exchange of medical knowledge and materials. At the center of this exchange was Dioscorides.

## Legacy in the Arabic World

The Arabic world would produce many works inspired by De Materia Medica. Of these, perhaps the most famous is the Qanun or The Canon of Medicine. Written in the eleventh century by the Muslim philosopher, physician, and poet Avicenna, the Qanun was a five book overview of all the medical knowledge in the Islamic world. This manuscript went on to become one of the standard medical textbooks in Europe until the 18th century.
